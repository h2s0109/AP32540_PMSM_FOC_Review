 *
 * @image html "Park.gif"
 *
 * The Park transformation is a vector rotation that converts from the stationary
 * reference frame \f$ (\alpha, \beta) \f$ to the rotating reference frame
 * \f$ (d, q) \f$ attached to the rotor flux using the following formula:
 *
 * \f$
 *   \begin{bmatrix}
 *  i_{sd} \\
 *  i_{sq}
 *  \end{bmatrix}
 *  =
 *  \begin{bmatrix}
 *  \cos \varphi & \sin \varphi \\
 *  -\sin \varphi & \cos \varphi
 *  \end{bmatrix}
 *  *
 *  \begin{bmatrix}
 *  i_{s\alpha} \\
 *  i_{s\beta}
 *  \end{bmatrix}
 * \f$
 *
 * The reverse Park transformation does the conversion back to the stationary
 * reference frame using the following formula:
 *
 * \f$
 *  \begin{bmatrix}
 *  i_{s\alpha} \\
 *  i_{s\beta}
 *  \end{bmatrix}
 *  =
 *  \begin{bmatrix}
 *  \cos \varphi & -\sin \varphi \\
 *  \sin \varphi & \cos \varphi
 *  \end{bmatrix}
 *  *
 *  \begin{bmatrix}
 *  i_{sd} \\
 *  i_{sq}
 *  \end{bmatrix}
 * \f$
